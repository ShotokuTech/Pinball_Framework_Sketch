# Pinball_Framework_Sketch
A friend of my YouTube channel bought me a few coffees to help him with his project.

This simple sketch is my take on the overall control of the game. One button starts the game. The other launches the balls. You will need to define the digital pins according to how you wire your buttons to your board of choice. I'm using the T-Display E-Paper with builtin buttons on pins 0 and 35. 

Stay tuned! Thanks.
